# 100DaysOfCode-Challenge
Repository to track my 100 Days of Code progress.
I am currently Learning Web Development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

Day 1: January 28, Tuesday 2025
Today's Progress: I watched a video on Variables and Data Types(JavaScript)
Thoughts: I have a basic understanding of variables and data type but do not feel confident yet. I need to have another look at this, before moving onto the next topic.
